# Handling-Missing-Data
The missing data in datasets could be removed or replaced by certain techniques like correlation, regression, mean and median.

Handling missing data is a crucial step in data analysis as missing data can lead to biased results and inaccurate conclusions. There are several techniques that can be used to handle missing data, and some of the most commonly used ones are:

- Correlation: Correlation is a statistical technique used to measure the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables. It can be used to identify patterns in the data and help to impute missing values. For example, if two variables have a strong positive correlation, we can use the values of one variable to predict the missing values of the other variable.

- Mean: The mean is a measure of central tendency that represents the average value of a dataset. When missing data is present, one approach is to replace the missing values with the mean value of the available data. This technique assumes that the missing values are similar to the available data.

- Median: The median is another measure of central tendency that represents the middle value in a dataset. When the data is skewed, the median is a better measure of central tendency than the mean. This technique can be used to replace the missing values with the median value of the available data.

- Regression: Regression is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between two or more variables. It can be used to predict the missing values based on the relationship between the available variables. For example, if there is a strong linear relationship between two variables, we can use regression to predict the missing values of one variable based on the values of the other variable.

In summary, handling missing data is an important step in data analysis, and there are several techniques that can be used to handle missing data. The choice of technique depends on the characteristics of the data and the research question at hand.
